console.log('Hello World);
```

# Motivation

Hey I'm very happy that you visit my site, after some time I finally made it and developed my own site with blog.

As a real developer should do I didn't just use a ready made solution or just wordpress but I developed everything myself with a fancy framework.

My main motivation consists of 5 reasons:

1. to help other developers
2. to document my own way as a developer for myself
3. to become public and promote myself as a professional engineer
4. learn Tailwind (yes this site was developed with Tailwind.)
5. to become better in english
